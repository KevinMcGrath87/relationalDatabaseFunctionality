# relationalDatabaseFunctionality
using relations and joins in MYSQL to access data related to particular elements in another table
Dear Instructor.

I know this isn't using the Ninjas and Dojos database setup but I really wanted to try and work on a database that I might be interested in developing in the futue. I know the format isnt quite what its supposed to be in the assignment, but I do have a good deal of functionality and I am using the relational database structure to organize the data. I hope you will still count this submittal.
